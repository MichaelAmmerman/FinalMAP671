## Reason for Creating this Map

I am an extension associate at the Universiy of Kentucky for the Dapartment of Forestry. My job requires that I travel all over the state of Kentucky. While traveling throughout the state, I have spent a lot of time in the state's largest and smallest cities. Over time I have noticed one thing that almost everytown has and that is either a Subway or McDonalds. This observation made me start to wonder what states have the most McDonalds and what trends cause this. I hypothesised that states with smaller populations would have more McDonalds for fewer people. After analysing and mapping the data I relized that my hypothesis wasa mostly correct, but it seems states within the southern us had more McDonald's.
